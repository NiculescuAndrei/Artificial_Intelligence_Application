# Artificial_Intelligence_Application
Suppose two friends live in different cities on a map, such as the Romania map
shown in Figure 2. On every turn, we can simultaneously move each friend to
a neighboring city on the map. The amount of time needed to move from city
i to neighbor j is equal to the road distance d(i, j) between the cities, but on
each turn the friend that arrives first must wait until the other one arrives (and
calls the first on his/her cell phone) before the next turn can begin. We want
the two friends to meet as quickly as possible.
a. Write a detailed formulation for this search problem.
b. Identify a search algorithm for this task and explain your choice.
